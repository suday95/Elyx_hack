# Health Guidance RAG Chatbot

A contextual health guidance chatbot integrating document ingestion, semantic search (via ChromaDB), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), role-based expertise, and user simulation for longitudinal interaction.

## 🧩 Overview

This project builds an interactive health chatbot system that “remembers” past documents and chats, supports structured retrieval-augmented answers, and can simulate long-term user interactions for data generation and evaluation.

## ✨ Features

- **Ingestion Pipeline:** Converts raw documents into embeddings, storing them in ChromaDB/SQLite for efficient vector search.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Answers use relevant past data, combining document context with the latest user question before invoking the LLM.
- **Role-Based Responses:** Dynamically chooses expert roles for answers based on trigger keywords, supporting multiple specialized personas.
- **Longitudinal Simulation:** Automatically generates 8 months of realistic chat data from a simulated user profile, including health plan timelines, symptoms, travel/illness events, and regular dialog.
- **Automated User via OpenRouter API:** Questions are generated programmatically for robust and consistent evaluation.
- **Event Engine:** Simulates random travel and illness events over time based on profile configs, RNG seeds, and Bernoulli trials.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/)
- SQLite
- OpenRouter API key (or compatible LLM endpoint)
- Optional: Docker, Streamlit, dotenv

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-guidance-rag-chatbot.git](https://github.com/suday95/Elyx_hack)
   cd health-guidance-rag-chatbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

- **Build Embeddings/Database:**
  ```bash
  python ingest_pipeline.py
  ```

- **Launch the Chatbot:**
  ```bash
  streamlit run chatbot_app.py
  ```

- **Simulate 8 Months of User Interaction:**
  ```bash
  python simulate_longterm_chats.py --profile profile.json
  ```

- **Generate a Summary of Events:**
  Output is saved as both a user-facing summary and a structured event log CSV.

## 🛠️ Architecture

- **Embedding Pipeline:** Splits documents, generates embeddings, stores in ChromaDB (SQLite backend).[1]
- **RAG Chain:** At query time, retrieves relevant text chunks; combines them with the new prompt for context-aware answers.
- **Role Logic:** Detects keywords, routes questions to respective expert “roles” (doctor, nurse, pharmacist, etc.) for tailored responses.
- **Simulation Engine:** Loads configs, sets random seeds, simulates travel/illness using parameterized randomization, generates plausible timelines.
- **Orchestration:** All components communicate to deliver end-to-end, data-grounded Q&A and event simulation.

## 📋 Example User Story

> The simulated user follows a health plan, traveling and falling ill according to a semi-random but realistic calendar. The bot provides role-specific insights, and after each event/diagnosis, pushes an update. Eight months of diverse health interactions are generated and logged for analysis.

## 🤖 Tech Stack

- Python, ChromaDB, SQLite
- OpenRouter (LLM API)
- Streamlit (UI)
- dotenv, pandas, numpy

## 🔒 Security

- **Do NOT commit API keys or secrets.**  
  Add all credentials/config files (like `.env`) to `.gitignore`.
